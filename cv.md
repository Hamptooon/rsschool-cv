## üéØ About Me

I am a 4th-year student at **RTU MIREA**, specializing in Information Systems and Technologies. In 2023, I joined **School 21**, an educational project by Sberbank, to enhance my skills in IT.

- **What I've done so far**:
  - Participated in educational projects.
  - Completed online courses on platforms like Stepik.
  - Studied books like _‚ÄúJavaScript: The Definitive Guide‚Äù_ by David Flanagan and _‚ÄúSecrets of the JavaScript Ninja‚Äù_.
